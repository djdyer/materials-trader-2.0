      Welcome to Materials Trader! An emerging peer-to-peer bulk recycling network, facilitating the exchange of waste materials between all sustainably conscious consumers and businesses. 
	As we all try to do our part in recycling waste, it comes as a disappointment to learn about the inefficiencies of state and local infrastructure. As of 2017, the EPA reported a mere 35% of our waste was recycled or composted. This is largely due to contamination. Over the past few decades China has been accepting much of the worlds waste. But with the 2018 National Sword Policy, has now banned the import of most plastics. With such reliance on export, our domestic programs fall far short. The time has come for consumers to take matters into their own hands.
	With Materials Trader, you can create your account today. Start posting materials to a network of interested parties. Choose from paper, plastic, glass, aluminum, all the way to textiles, electronics, batteries, and appliances. Post a photo description and approximation of amount, size or weight, along with contact and pickup location details of your preference. Of course, you can also search by material, and conveniently edit or delete your posts. Let’s get to work, getting materials into the right hands, for those that care about actually recycling a world of products deemed recyclable.
